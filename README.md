This is a minimal simulation of an HP2671 thermal printer to support older HP instruments, it runs under Linux as a console-mode program.

Input is via a Fenrir/Prologix adapter as sold for example by https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5256129?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000007.1.77305be17cn6AE Since this is to at least some extent a clone- or at least a "homage to"- a commercial product, please do not direct support questions to Prologix unless you are prepared to purchase one of their own adapters.

Input may be text (e.g. from an HP16300 logic analyzer) or bitmap (e.g. from an HP54501A 'scope), other devices have not been tested. In the case of graphical input the output is a .bmp file, command line options provide minimal support for colour and margin definition.
